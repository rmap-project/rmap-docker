# RMap in Docker

## Quickstart

> `docker-machine` users be sure to configure your environment using `eval $(docker-machine env <machine-name>)`

1. Check out this repository, and cd into `rmap-docker`
2. Edit `.env`
    -  `RMAP_BASEURL` must be changed if you are on `docker-machine`
    -  `ACTIVE_SPRING_PROFILES` (_optional_, e.g. to change the idservice used)
3. One of:
    - `docker-compose pull` to retrieve the latest images on Docker Hub
    - `docker-compose build --nocache` to build images using the SNAPSHOTs from the Maven repository
4. Run `docker-compose up -d` to launch the containers in the background
5. Run `docker logs -f rmap-apps` to determine when RMap is up and ready

If this is your very first time launching RMap from Docker, you'll need to complete some one-time startup tasks below.

### Service locations

This boots RMap with the following:

> `docker-machine` users substitute your active machine's IP address for `localhost`

* RDF4J server running on port `8081`, with a triplestore repository named `docker`.
  * Server available at: `http://localhost:8081/rdf4j-server/`
  * Workbench available at `http://localhost:8081/rdf4j-workbench/`
  
* Postgres database running on port `5432` with a database named `postgres`, user: `postgres`, and no password.
  * Postgres JDBC url: `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres`

* Solr running on port `8983` with the `discos` core
  * Solr url: `http://localhost:8983/solr/#/discos`
  
* Kafka and Zookeeper running on ports `29092` and `32181` respectively

* RMap API and HTML UI running on port `8080`:
  * API available at: `http://localhost:8080/api/`
  * HTML UI available at: `http://localhost:8080/app/`
    * Admin login: `http://localhost:8080/app/admin/login`, user `rmapAdmin`, password `changeme`
 
### Spring profiles   

The Spring profiles that are in effect by default are:
* persistent-db
* inmemory-idservice
* http-triplestore
* http-solr
* prod-kafka
* auto-start-indexing

Modify the value of `ACTIVE_SPRING_PROFILES` in `.env`, then run `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d` to update.

### Data persistence

Data generated by RMap and its services are persisted in Docker volumes.  Index content, database content, triplestore content, and Kafka/Zookeeper content should be persisted across multiple invocations of `docker-compose down` and `docker-compose up`.

## Start up tasks

These are tasks that need to be completed when first launching RMap with Docker.  Because the containers use volumes to persist changes, the tasks performed below only need to be performed once (unless the Docker volumes are removed).

1. Create a triple store named `docker`
2. Login to the RMap application as an admin and create a user
3. (_optional_) If using the [rmap-loader](https://github.com/rmap-project/rmap-loader), create a Postgres database named `loader`

### Creating a triplestore

> `docker-machine` users substitute your Docker machine IP address for `localhost`

1. Navigate to the RDF4J Workbench: `http://localhost:8081/rdf4j-workbench/`
1. Create a new repository
    - Name it `docker`
    - In order for the triplestore to persist across restarts, use `Native Java Store` as the type.
    - Accept defaults for indexes, strict mode etc.
